I am a freelance writer and editor from Philadelphia, PA.

I write about art and culture---both as objects of enjoyment and as companions that help us better understand the challenges of our present moment. While I do not think all art need be uncomplicated or didactic, I am interested in art that offers radical insights and helps us to think about how we might build a more compassionate, sustainable world. My writing has appeared in *Public Books*, Medium's *Tenderly*, and *Broad Street Review*.

I have a Ph.D. in English from [Rutgers University](http://www.rutgers.edu), where I studied nineteenth-century British literature. My research was supported by awards from the Jacob K. Javits Fellowship program, the Center for Cultural Analysis, and the Rutgers Department of English.
