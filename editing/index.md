I offer editing services for academics and writers looking to publish their research, reach new audiences, and produce
professional documents. I have listed some of my services below, but the cost for editorial services varies based on the
type and extent of editing your project requires. Feel free to [e-mail me](mailto:matthew.john.phillips@gmail.com) to
discuss your project and how I can help.

> "My press recommended Matthew, and when we communicated, his timely and clear reply assured me he was a great fit. His attention to polishing the manuscript AND attention to the notes/bibliography were essential to getting the manuscript ready for final submission ... I look forward to working with him on future projects."

## General Editing

Editing is a complex, multi-step process and can take place at any point within the timeline of a project. Developmental
editing looks at the big picture for a project, including its overall ambition and scope. Developmental editing can be
useful for any writer who is looking to begin a new project or is in the early stages of a project. A development editor
can also look at early manuscripts or drafts in order to think about the overall structure and effectiveness of a
project.

Substantive editing can happen at any time but tends to focus on the overall structure, organization, and clarity of the
writing. You might hire an editor if you are looking to tighten your prose or clarify your ideas. An editor can also
help when you are writing for a new audience for the first time. For example, if you are an academic who is looking to
write for a wider public, it can be useful to hire an editor outside of your field of specialization to translate your
research.

I have experience working with professionals and academics in the humanities, social sciences, health care, and social
work. No matter where you are in your project, I would be excited to help!

## Copyediting and Proofreading

Copyediting, or line editing, focuses on the quality and comprehension of your prose. It falls somewhere between
developmental editing and proofreading.

Proofreading entails granular, technical editing, with a focus on the mechanics of grammar and style. A proofreader can also be used to help
ensure your project adheres to a particular style guide, like the Chicago Manual of Style.

## Indexing

While many authors may elect to create their own index, an experienced indexer can help to transform a manuscript and make vital connections for an author.

When creating an index, I try to approach your manuscript from the perspective of a reader. Yet, I also have a background in academic research, so I know how to create an index that will help to facilitate academic research. My goal is to make your book or project as accessible to as many readers as possible.

I have completed the indexes for the following books:

- Jason A. Bartles, *Arteletra: The Sixties in Latin America and the Politics of Going Unnoticed* (Purdue University Press, forthcoming)
- Stephanie Y. Evans, *Black Women's Yoga History: Memoirs of Inner Peace* (SUNY Press, forthcoming)
