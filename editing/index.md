I offer editing services for academics and writers. I have listed some of my services below, but the cost for editorial services varies based on the type and extent of editing your project requires. Feel free to [e-mail me](mailto:matthew.john.phillips@gmail.com) to discuss your project and how I can help!

> "My press recommended Matthew, and when we communicated, his timely and clear reply assured me he was a great fit. His attention to polishing the manuscript AND attention to the notes/bibliography were essential to getting the manuscript ready for final submission ... I look forward to working with him on future projects."

## Developmental Editing

Developmental editing can be
useful for any writer who is looking to begin a new project or is in the early stages of a project. A development editor
can also look at early manuscripts or drafts in order to think about the overall structure and effectiveness of a
project.

## Copyediting and Proofreading

Copyediting, or line editing, focuses on the quality and comprehension of your prose. It falls somewhere between
developmental editing and proofreading.

Proofreading entails granular, technical editing, with a focus on the mechanics of grammar and style. A proofreader can also be used to help
ensure your project adheres to a particular style guide, like the Chicago Manual of Style.

## Indexing

While many authors may elect to create their own index, an experienced indexer can help to transform a manuscript and make vital connections for an author.

When creating an index, I try to approach your manuscript from the perspective of a reader. Yet, I also have a background in academic research, so I know how to create an index that will help to facilitate academic research. My goal is to make your book or project as accessible to as many readers as possible.

I have completed the indexes for the following books:

- Jason A. Bartles, *Arteletra: The Sixties in Latin America and the Politics of Going Unnoticed* (Purdue University Press, forthcoming)
- Stephanie Y. Evans, *Black Women's Yoga History: Memoirs of Inner Peace* (SUNY Press, forthcoming)
- Zaid Al-Ali, *Arab Constitutionalism: The Coming Revolution* (Cambridge University Press, 2021)
- Jean-Thomas Tremblay and Andrew Strombeck, eds., *Avant-Gardes in Crisis: Art and Politics in the Long 1970s* (SUNY Press, 2021)
- Ryan Watson, *Radical Documentary and Global Crises: Militant Evidence in the Digital Age* (Indiana University Press, 2021)
- Christopher Roberts, *Alternative Approaches to Human Rights: The Disparate Historical Paths of the European, Inter-American and African Regional Human Rights* (Cambridge University Press, forthcoming)
- Shirin E. Edwins, *The Space of the Transnational: Feminisms and Ummah in African and Southeast Asian Writing* (SUNY Press, forthcoming)
- David Kurnick, *The Savage Detectives Reread* (Columbia University Press, forthcoming)
