Welcome to "Open + Worlds," a personal blog that explores the intersections of art and life.

In the coming weeks, I plan to publish blog posts on literature, video games, food, and culture more broadly. I hope to use this space as a repository of ideas for future essays, where I can experiment with avenues of thought before committing them to writing. While a lot of writers are choosing to forego blogs in favor of newsletters, I don't have enough of an audience to make that worthwhile. Instead, I plan to use this like a commonplace book, where I can gather together my sundry scraps of ideas and interests in one place.[^1]

I do not believe I'll ever develop an audience for my blog, but I do hope that others will find the ideas I explore herein to be interest or worth engaging. For now, though, these blog posts will be mere preludes to more substantive writing.

I hope to publish at least once a week. Until then, I leave you with this picture of my beautiful pups.
