Welcome to "Open + Worlds," a personal blog that explores the intersections of art and life.

In the coming weeks, I plan to publish blog posts on literature, video games, food, and culture more broadly. I hope to use this space as a repository of ideas for future essays, where I can experiment with avenues of thought before committing them to writing. It'll be experimental, occasionally offering nothing more than half-formed thoughts, but I hope that, as time goes on, these will develop into a coherent mission and ideology. In other words: a horizon to contain the many worlds I hope to explore.

While a lot of writers are choosing to forego blogs in favor of newsletters, I don't have enough of an audience to make that worthwhile. There is a reality to the cultural market that ideas have more reality when expressed to a already existing audience. Many writers have earned their audiences, but it doesn't change the fact that the cultural market (centered in New York, and largely a product of elite, white institutions) is inimical to the unestablished. Perhaps one day I'll have an audience to make the effort of writing a newsletter viable. Instead, I plan to use this blog like a commonplace book, a place to gather together my sundry scraps of ideas and interests in one place. Instead of a journal (too personal, too introspective), it'll be like a repository for the preservation and development of my ideas.

I do not believe I'll ever develop an audience for my blog, but I do hope that others will find the ideas I explore to be interesting or worth engaging. For now, though, these blog posts will be mere preludes to more substantive writing.

I hope to publish at least once a week. Until then, I leave you with this picture of my beautiful pups.
