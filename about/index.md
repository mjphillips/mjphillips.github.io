I am a freelance writer and editor from Philadelphia, PA.

I write about art and culture---both as objects of enjoyment and as companions. I am interested in art that offers radical insights and helps us to think about how we might build a more compassionate, sustainable world. My writing has appeared in *Public Books*, Medium's *Tenderly*, *Broad Street Review*, and *Full Stop*.

I have a Ph.D. in English from [Rutgers University](http://www.rutgers.edu), where I studied nineteenth-century British literature. My research was supported by awards from the Jacob K. Javits Fellowship program, the Center for Cultural Analysis, and the Rutgers Department of English.

Reach me by e-mail at [matthew.john.phillips [at] gmail.com](mailto:matthew.john.phillips@gmail.com).

I tweet at [@mjphillips](twitter.com/mjphillips).

Follow my newsletter [*Open + Worlds*](https://matthewjohnphillips.substack.com), where I write about literature, video games, and, against my better judgment, "culture."
